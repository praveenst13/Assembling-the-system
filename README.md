# EX-NO:1 Assembling-the-system
## Aim:
   To assemble the system 
## Materials Requeried :
 • Case
 
 • Motherboard
 
 • Central Processing Unit(CPU)
 
 • Solid State Drive (SSD) or Hard disk drive (HDD)
 
 • Graphics Processing Unit(GPU)
 
 • CPU Cooling System
 
 • Random Access Memory(RAM)
 
 • Thermal Paste
 
 • Power Supply Unit (PSU)
 
 • Phillips Screwdriver
 
 • Hard Drive (Optional)
 
 • Additional cooling systems(Optional)
 
 • All manuals for each
 
 
 • component (*can be foundonline if not provided)
 
## Procedurce:
   
### Step1: Create a Space to Work
  • This step is important as all components are small.
  
  • Preferably a flat open space with lots of room to work where you are comfortable working.
### Step 2: Installing Motherboard

  • Gently grab the CPU avoiding the golden pins on the back side. Carefully place the CPU in the housing in the correct orientation which should be marked with a symbol or notches which are on both the CPU and motherboard. This should fit easily and shouldn’t need to be forced in the socket.
  
  • After the CPU is in the housing, close the latch on the housing. This part may need to be forced and some motherboards come with a plastic piece that will pop off the front once closed, this part should be saved.
  

 
### Step 3: Applying Thermal Paste/ Installing the cooling system
   • After the CPU is installed apply a pea-sized amount of thermal paste directly in the center of the front of the CPU. If too much is applied, it will spill over and this can be cleaned with rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab/ paper towel.
   
   • After the paste is applied view the instructions that come with the cooling system to finish installation as all cooling systems differ based on the type of cooling being used.
   
   • Plug in the cooling system into the motherboard that is labeled ‘CPU fan’ or ‘CPU fan header’ to power the system, if an all-in-one system is being used there should be a place labeled ‘AIO pump’ to plug a second cable in to
   


### Step 4: Installing the Solid-State Drive (SSD) or Hard disk drive

   • This step requires you to find the contact points, which should be easily found by looking at the motherboard’s manual.
   
   • After the SSD is plugged in you will want to secure it with the screw that is provided, this may require a small amount of force to install

### Step 5: Installing the Random-Access Memory (RAM)
   • Before installing make sure the clamps that house the RAM are open.
   
   • Align the RAM sticks so they correspond with the breakpoints on the motherboard,avoid touching the golden contact points. This shouldn’t have to be forced and should fit with ease.
   
   • Once installed close the clamps that house the RAM to secure. Refer to the motherboard’s manual for optimal placement of RAM

### Step 6: Installing additional cooling systems (optional)
   • This step also varies widely depending on the size of your case, and the slots available for additional fans. Visit the manual of your case for instructions.
   
   • Orient the fans to make sure the air is flowing into the case which should be visible by the cross bars on the back of the fans.
   
   • Once the fans have been installed make sure to plug them into the fan headers on the motherboard to provide power, this is also where it might be useful to have zip ties for cord management to keep the interior looking neat.
   
   • This part only applies if you are using an all-in-one cooling system. Once you have your fans installed, attach the radiator to the main fans/fan, the radiator tends to be large, so you’ll want to make sure there is enough space for it.
   

### Step 7: Installing the power supply unit (PSU)

   • Slide the PSU into the designated location and make sure the fan is oriented pointing outside the case.
   
   • Use the screws provided to lock the PSU into the correct place.
   
   • The motherboard will have a 24-pin connection that will need to be plugged in, and a 4-8-pin connector for the CPU that needs to be connected.
   
   • The hard drives that you may have installed will require power as well.
   
   • You will have to connect the cords into the corresponding outlets which should be labeled.
   
   • To connect all switches and USB ports you will have to pull out the cords that were tucked away in Installing input Output shield 
   
   • Inspect each cord to find the corresponding port on the motherboard

### Step 8: Installing the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
   • Remove as many barrier slots as you need depending on the size of your GPU. These slots are located on the outside of the case between the input output shield and the back of the PSU. These may have to be unscrewed or just removed with force depending on the case.
   
   
   • Gently pick up the GPU and avoid touching the golden contact points.
   
   • Align the GPU with the PCI lane which is on the motherboard and should be running horizontally and be next to the shields previously removed.
   
   • This should be placed without much force and once placed if you removed screws from the slots the screws should be replaced to secure the GPU

   
   • If your GPU has a cord to connect power, plug that into the corresponding slot into the PSU

## output:

After assembling 

![Assembled-Desktop-Computer-10th-Gen](https://github.com/praveenst13/Assembling-the-system/assets/118787793/efcb02a0-5d34-4df3-a4e7-8d8bbb7ce6dc)

## Result:
 The build should now be completed. Plug in a mouse and keyboard and connect the monitor to the PC, after it is all connected plug in the PSU into an outlet and turn it on
